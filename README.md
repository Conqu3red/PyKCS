# PyKCS

PyKCS (pronounced pie-kay-cee-ess) is a command-line tool written in python that can convert text files to and from Kansas City Standard encoded WAV files. The Kansas City City standard was method of transferring data onto cassette tapes, created in the early 70's to help supply the early home computer market with access to cheap and readily-accessible mass storage before the advent of cheap non-volatile memory. The entire script was written using the specifications in the KCS Wikipedia page (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kansas_City_standard), and reverse-engineered recordings produced by the KCS08 DOS program (https://github.com/privatezero/KCS) which is virtually the only KCS decoder-encoder software still on the internet.* PyKCS is command compatible with KCS08, although currently does not have all the same features.

*We found some more programs with KCS decoders/encoders that are in plain C (https://web.archive.org/web/20000411080616/www.homepages.hetnet.nl/~wouterras/atom.htm)

## Installation

There is a C version on the way!
